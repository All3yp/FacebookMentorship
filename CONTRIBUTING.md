# How to Contribute

### 0. Fork this project.

### 1. Create an Issue with the following name convention:
  
  `<title of the exercise> - <language you are solving it> - <Week>`
  
  For example: **Add Digits - C - Week 0.**

### 2. After solving the exercise, create a folder structure with the following convention:

* Create a folder with the week number.
* Create a subfolder with the name of the exercise.
* Put your solution file there with the title in *lowercase* and *snake_case* format. 

Following the previous example:

```
Week 0
   â””â”€â”€ Add Digits
          â””â”€â”€ add_digits.c
```

If the folders already exists, just add to it following the same convention. Example:

```
Week 0
   â””â”€â”€ Add Digits
          â””â”€â”€ add_digits.c
          â””â”€â”€ add_digits.py
   â””â”€â”€ Binary Search
          â””â”€â”€ binary_search.c
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request with the same name of the Issue, and assign me for review.

I will be at least marking as `hacktoberfest-accepted` all good Pull Requests during hacktoberfest :)
